# Difference between C and C++

## Basics
- Use `g++` to compile your C++ code.
- Must include `iostreams` for input/output operations.
- Use `using namespace std;` to simplify your code.  We will describe more detial on this.
- Read input with `cin`, and write output with `cout`.
- `endl` means the end of line.

## Variables
- Use `{}` to initialize a variable.
- Note the defference between *assignment* and *initialization*.
- `bool` in C++ is a built-in type so you do not need to include 'bool.h', like in C99.

## Input and Output
- You can use `cin` and `cout` on any built-in data tyoe without a format stirng.  They will work correctly according to the data type of the variables.  We will describe more on this *polymorphism*.
